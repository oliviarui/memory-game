# memory-game
This memory game flashes squares in a particular sequence. The user has to remember that sequence and then repeat it when it is time.
Although this game has the CSS needed to scale to tablets and phones, the mousedown and mouseup functions used to indicate that a user has clicked on a square
does not work with touchscreen. So on tablets and phones, although technically playable, the user will not get feedback on their clicks.
